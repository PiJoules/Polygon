        The alpha filter returns a weighted sum of the new sensor value and old 
        sensor value. Raising the value of alpha will give more weight to the 
        accelerometer data and allow for more responsive controls. Decreasing 
        alpha will give more weight to the previous filter value and allow for 
        smoother controls.

    <string name="sma_description">
        The Simple Moving Average (SMA) Filter returns the average of the last 
        N number of sensor values. Raising N increases the number of values that 
        will be averaged and allow for smoother controls. Decreasing N lessens 
        the number of values that will be averaged and allow for more responsive 
        controls.

    <string name="none_description">
        Noise returned by the accelerometer will not be filtered out, but the 
        controls will be very responsive and allow for more sudden movements.
